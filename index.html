<h2>What is an airplane?</h2>
<p id="myTopic">So, what is an airplane?</p> 

<p>Is it something that you sit in and fly through the air? 

Well, in that case, any child riding a bicycle and jumping over mud puddles is a pilot. </p>

<p>So it's something that has to stay in the air after it leaves the ground, right? It cannot simply ascend and then descend, it needs some sort of mechanism to stay there.</p>

<p>Well, that's boring.
We may add some way for it to move under its own power. Is it an airplane? Not quite, now we have a blimp.</p>

<p>Alright, let's not waste our time anymore. We got it! An airplane is an airplane, not something else. 
It can be defined.
And that is where the entire fight between The Wright Brothers and Santos&#8209Dumont begins.  </p>

<p>Although the Wright Brothers did a good job, it can be argued it was not an airplane. Perhaps a catapult launched aircraft, maybe a glorified glider. Important, smart, I know. I could not do it myself, I promise. But still, it is not an airplane. 

To achieve true flight, an airplane must generate both lift and thrust in greater amounts than the pull of gravity and drag.</p>

<p>So, what made the airplane created by Santos&#8209Dumont special? Well, in addition to being able to taxi and take off under it's own power, without a sled or a catapult, and maintain airspeed and altitude.

Also it was well documented, which was not always the case of the Wright Brothers attempts. </p>

<p>We will continue to examine this argument!</p>
