<h2>What is an airplane?</h2>
<p>So, what is an airplane? 

Is it something that you sit in and fly through the air? 

Well, in that case, any child riding a bicycle and jumping over mud puddles is a pilot. </p>

So it's something that has to stay in the air after it leaves the ground, right?

Well, we may add some propulsion. Is it an airplaine? Here we go, we have a blimp.

Alright, let's not waste our time anymore. We got it! An airplane is an airplane, not something else. It can be defined.
And that is where the entire fight between The Wright Brothers and Santos Dumont begins.  

Although the Wright Brothers did a good job, it can be argued it was not an airplane. It was more like a catpult. Important, smart, I know. I could not do it myself, I promise. But still, it is not an airplane. 

To achieve true flight, an airplane must generate both lift and thrust in greater amounts than the pull of gravity and drag.

So, what made the airplane created by Santos&#8209Dumont special?

We will continue to examine this argument!
